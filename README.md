# Multi-step Form

This project accepts questions, steps through the questions one at a time, and finally display the result.

It's able to construct complex form validation requirement, and although currently it only supports 'text' and 'select' questions, other types of question should share the similar pattern in code easily.

## Demo

## UI component library

Adapted a [bunch of reusable components](https://github.com/kilgarenone/towernest/tree/master/src/components) from my previous side-project that did a similar multi-step form feature.

They reside in `src/components`.

## Third-party library

**[Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik)**

Has a helpful [multi-step form example](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/blob/master/examples/MultistepWizard.js) as a starting point.

**[Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)**

Used to construct form validation schema.

## Build

The build setup that uses Webpack is adapted from my other side-project(private repo).

Here is the main [`webpack.config.js`](https://github.com/kilgarenone/kd-assignment/blob/master/webpack.config.js) file.

Here is the [webpack-related configuration](https://github.com/kilgarenone/kd-assignment/tree/master/config/webpack) broken into `dev` and `prod` mode.

### TODO

- [ ] UI/UX polishing
- [ ] Offline mode
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Build a kitchen sink to showcase and document the UI components
- [ ] Refine the 'progress bar' behaviour
